COMPILATION OF MaxCut
=====================

1. Download a version of Bcp (which contains MaxCut as an
   application). In the rest of the this file we will use version
   1.2.1 as an example. Suppose that the source is unpacked and now
   resides in some_path/Bcp-1.2.1.

2. Build and install Bcp. Please refer to Bcp-1.2.1/INSTALL for
   instructions. Suppose that Bcp is installed into BcpInstallDir
   (if Bcp-1.2.1/INSTALL is followed exactly then BcpInstallDir is
   Bcp-1.2.1/build). Then the Bcp headers and libs are installed in
   BcpInstallDir/include and BcpInstallDir/lib.

3. Change directory into BcpInstallDir/Applications/MaxCut and use
   'make' to compile the MaxCut example. This creates the 'maxcut'
   executable. 

DOCUMENTATION
=============

If you have Doxygen available, you can create the html documentation 
by typing

   make doxydoc

in the build directory. Then open the file 

   Bcp-1.2.1/doxydoc/html/index.html 

with a browser. Note that this creates the documentation for all the
projects in the package. If you prefer to generate the documentation 
only for a subset of these projects, you can edit the file 
  
   Bcp-1.2.1/doxydoc/doxygen.conf 

to exclude directories (using the EXCLUDE variable, for example).

If Doxygen is not available, the html documentation is available at:

   http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/


RUNNING MaxCut
==============

1. In BcpInstallDir/Applications/MaxCut, use './maxcut junger1.par'
   to run the example code. 


CREATING FURTHER INSTANCES
==========================

In the Bcp-1.2.1/Applications/MaxCut/Generators directory there are
4 generators that create graphs with different edge weight
distributions. The first comment in the files describe what kind of
instances they create. They are all standalone programs; the
Makefile shows how to compile them.
