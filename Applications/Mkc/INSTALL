COMPILATION OF Mkc
=====================

1. Download a version of Bcp (which contains Mkc as an
   application). In the rest of the this file we will use version
   1.2.1 as an example. Suppose that the source is unpacked and now
   resides in some_path/Bcp-1.2.1.

2. Build and install Bcp. Please refer to Bcp-1.2.1/INSTALL for
   instructions. Suppose that Bcp is installed into BcpInstallDir
   (if Bcp-1.2.1/INSTALL is followed exactly then BcpInstallDir is
   Bcp-1.2.1/build). Then the Bcp headers and libs are installed in
   BcpInstallDir/include and BcpInstallDir/lib.

3. Change directory into BcpInstallDir/Applications/Mkc and use
   'make' to compile the Mkc example. This creates the 'mkc'
   executable. 

DOCUMENTATION
=============

If you have Doxygen available, you can create the html documentation 
by typing

   make doxydoc

in the build directory. Then open the file 

   Bcp-1.2.1/doxydoc/html/index.html 

with a browser. Note that this creates the documentation for all the
projects in the package. If you prefer to generate the documentation 
only for a subset of these projects, you can edit the file 
  
   Bcp-1.2.1/doxydoc/doxygen.conf 

to exclude directories (using the EXCLUDE variable, for example).

If Doxygen is not available, the html documentation is available at:

   http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/


RUNNING Mkc
==============

1. cd into BcpInstallDir/Applications/Mkc and uncompress the mkc
   instance file: 'gunzip -c mkc.mps.gz > mkc.mps'
2. Run the code with './mkc mkc.par'
