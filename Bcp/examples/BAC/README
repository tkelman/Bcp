BAC README

BAC is distributed under the Common Public License Version 1.0 and is 
freely redistributable. All source code and documentation is Copyright

BAC is an illustrative example for the Branch-Cut-Price code BCP of 
COIN-OR. BAC illustrates several basic features of BCP and it is hoped
that a study of the BAC example is an almost painless introduction
to BCP. BAC is not an efficient code for doing anything interesting,
besides serving as an example for BCP. The file bac.pdf in the main 
directory of the BAC example serves as main support for understanding 
the code.

INSTALLATION
============

If you have downloaded the package 

   https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Bcp/trunk

in the local directory coin-Bcp, please see the INSTALL file in 
coin-Bcp for a guide to install this package. 

If you have obtained BCP by downloading another package, BAC should be 
installed as part of the installation of that package. See the INSTALL 
file in the main directory of the package.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

If you have Doxygen available, you can build the html documentation 
by typing

   make doxydoc

in the directory from which you built the package Pkg dowloaded in,
say coin-Pkg. Then open the file 

   coin-Pkg/doxydoc/html/index.html 

with a browser. Note that this creates the documentation for all the
projects in the package. If you prefer to generate the documentation 
only for a subset of these projects, you can edit the file 
  
   coin-pkg/doxydoc/doxygen.conf 

to exclude directories (using the EXCLUDE variable, for example).

If Doxygen is not available, html documentation is available at:

   http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/
